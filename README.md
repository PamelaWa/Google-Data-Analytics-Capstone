## Backgroud
Bellabeat is a high-tech manufacturer of health-focused products for women since 2013. Inspiring and empowering women with knowledge about their own health and habits, Bellabeat has grown rapidly and quickly positioned itself as a tech-driven wellness company for females.

The co-founder and Chief Creative Officer, Urška Sršen knows that an analysis of Bellabeat’s available consumer data would reveal more opportunities for growth. She has
asked the marketing analytics team to focus on a Bellabeat product and analyze smart device usage data in order to gain
insight into how people are already using their smart devices. Then, using this information, she would like high-level
recommendations for how these trends can inform Bellabeat marketing strategy.
